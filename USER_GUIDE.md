# FPL Predictor User Guide

Welcome to the "Oracle" for Fantasy Premier League. This tool doesn't just give you raw numbers; it translates them into actionable strategy. Here is how to use it to win your mini-leagues.

## 1. Captaincy Personas
The "Recommendation" section offers 4 distinct paths for your Captaincy armband. Choose the one that fits your playstyle or current rank.

| Persona | Best For... | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🛡️ The Easy Choice** | **Protecting Rank** | The safest bet. This player has high ownership and consistent returns. If they haul, everyone has them. If they blank, it doesn't hurt you much. Use this when you are ahead. |
| **💥 The Obvious** | **Pure Points** | The algorithm's raw #1 pick. Mathematical superiority above all else, ignoring ownership or hype. |
| **🃏 The Joker** | **Chasing Rank** | High reward, higher risk. A player with low ownership who has "exploded" recently. If they score, you skyrocket past your rivals. Use this when you need to make up ground. |
| **🎢 The Fun One** | **The Thrill** | Strictly a Defender or Goalkeeper (The "Title Contender"). We pick them based on a mix of clean sheet odds and massive attacking threat (Defcon Score). Pick this if you want a reliable defender who can score. |

## 2. Key Concepts
*   **🧨 Explosivity Index**: A 0-100 score on every player card. It measures how likely a player is to get a "Haul" (10+ pts). If it's over 70, the player is "Fixture Proof".
*   **🛡️ Defcon Score**: The rating for defenders. High Defcon means they hunt for clean sheets AND goals.

## 3. The Optimized Squad
The "Squad" view isn't just a list of good players; it's a **blueprint**.

- **Transfer Planning**: Look at the "Optimized Squad" compared to your current team. Any overlapping players that you *don't* have are prime transfer targets.
- **Bench Strategy**: Notice who is on the bench. We optimize for a budget bench that still plays (e.g., £4.0m defenders who start games). This frees up money for premium attackers.

## 4. "The Oracle" vs. Your Gut
This tool is a decision-support system, not a dictator.
- **Use the Data**: To narrow down your shortlist (e.g., "I need a midfielder under £7m").
- **Use Your Gut**: To make the final call between the top 2 candidates.
- **Watch the Flags**: The algorithm updates daily, but always check for last-minute press conference injury news.
